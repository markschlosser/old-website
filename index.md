## Projects
- [mini-universe](https://github.com/markschlosser/mini-universe) - Simple-but-complex software written in C which simulates interesting emergant particle interactions based on infinitely configurable seed states.
- [codez4fun](https://markschlosser.github.io/codez4fun/) - Asynchronous word guessing game for teams written in JavaScript for browsers. It needs no login or cookies, just a key shared among gamemasters.

- [black and white photography](/bw) - Personal hobby photographs taken mainly with the Pentax Q series of cameras.
